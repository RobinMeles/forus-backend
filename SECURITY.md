## How Forus handles these reports

For the protection of our customers, Forus doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until our investigation is complete and any necessary updates are generally available.

Forus uses changelogs to publish information about security fixes in our products and to publicly credit people or organizations that have reported security issues to us.
